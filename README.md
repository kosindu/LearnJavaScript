I made this to share my knowledge with you ❤️️❤️️

I've made two files here 
* app.js
*  index.html

app.js will be contained all the core concepts about javascript

To view the file in good eye, you need to open it in the Visual Studio Code
And make sure to install the extension "Better Comments" by "Aaron Bond"
